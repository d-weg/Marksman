# codeindex-rs — benchmarks

Reproduce with `cargo build --release && python3 scripts/bench.py [oracle_repo]`.
Oracle = the sibling Node `codeindex` repo (TypeScript, ~600 symbols).

## Indexing speed (whole repo, wall-clock, min of 3 after warmup)

| variant | time |
|---|---|
| Rust · SCIP only (no tree-sitter) | 2.99s |
| **Rust · SCIP + tree-sitter** | **3.02s** |
| tree-sitter overhead | **+0.04s (+1.2%)** |
| Node (bge, the oracle) | 12.68s |

**Headlines:**
- The **SCIP + tree-sitter merge is essentially free** — +1.2% (~40ms) at index time. Adding the
  in-process AST (which unlocks sub-symbol edits) costs nothing measurable. This is the key result
  validating the merge.
- **Rust indexes ~4× faster than Node** (3s vs 12.7s). Part native Rust, part the potion-code
  Model2Vec embedder vs bge.
- Of the ~3s, the dominant cost is `scip-typescript` (the external indexer) + embedding; the
  language-blind Rust core is a small fraction.

## Retrieval overlap vs Node (Jaccard, per task)

| task | rust | node | shared | Jaccard |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| merge bm25/vector/symbol with RRF | 18 | 18 | 14 | 64% |
| ast-anchored structural edits + gate | 14 | 13 | 9 | 50% |
| package-aware relevance weighting | 15 | 14 | 9 | 45% |
| import graph + seed expansion | 16 | 16 | 12 | 60% |

**mean Jaccard ≈ 55%.**

This is honest moderate overlap, and the two divergences are *expected*: Rust uses **potion-code
Model2Vec** (the Node oracle here uses **bge-small**), and Rust's graph is **SCIP semantic
references** vs the Node tool's **ts-morph import declarations**. Same embedder + same graph would
converge further; the cores (BM25/RRF/weighting/expansion) are faithful ports.

## Edit / capability (not a timing)

| | SCIP only | **SCIP + tree-sitter** | Node (ts-morph) |
|---|---|---|---|
| rename / refs / import graph | ✅ compiler-grade | ✅ | ✅ |
| whole-symbol edits (replace_node) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| move (importer rewrite) | ✅ via LSP willRenameFiles | ✅ | ✅ |
| **sub-symbol edits** (body/return/param) | ❌ no AST | **✅ tree-sitter** | ✅ |
| external runtime dep for the AST | — | **none (in-process)** | Node |

The merge gives sub-symbol precision **with no external dependency** for the AST (tree-sitter is a
compiled-in Rust crate) and **no measurable index cost** — the best of both.

## Notes
- Edit-gate latency is dominated by the TS language server warmup (~5s first call) and is not a
  fair Rust-vs-Node number; omitted.
- Method: `--release` binary, `min of 3` after a discarded warmup run to control for
  scip-typescript / OS-cache effects.
